              Hi! My name is David and I was born in Olesa de Montserrat, a small town near Montserrat (a must-visit place!), but I live in Barcelona, where I have been teaching Spanish for more than 5 years. I love languages in general and I enjoy learning them while traveling! ðŸ˜Š

              The best thing about teaching: I love learning and teaching languages in an international and diverse environment. I believe that makes learning much more interesting and probably easier, as it increases students' motivation to practice. I think communication is the most important and natural skill to develop, and probably the most fun one too, so let's talk as much as we can!

              Favorite things: martial arts, learning and playing music, playing football, watching Youtube, learning languages.

              Favorite Spanish word: 'garbeo', which is a colloquial word that means taking a short walk around a city and intentionally getting lost to get to know it better.
